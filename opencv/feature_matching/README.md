# Feature Matching Study on a StarMap
For over a few weeks, I have been planning to study object detection deeply but I didn't know what would make me start...<br>...aand here it is!

I think you got the idea here :) It's quite easy to locate the position of a plain template taken from an image (here, it's the smaller frame at top right) but the problem arises when the template is zoomed, flipped and/or rotated etc. Certainly, there are multiple options to come up with a solution, and I used some pure Python skills to find its location _roughly_. However, **OpenCV** will come to our rescue and find its exact location!<br>

**Files:**<br>
* For the initial study, please see the [notebook](https://github.com/gulmert89/study_room/blob/main/opencv/feature_matching/starmap_notebook.ipynb) file. This will be the main file of the project and it can be followed to see the progress.<br>
* The modules that you will [require](https://github.com/gulmert89/study_room/blob/main/opencv/feature_matching/requirements.txt) to use the notebook. The script only needs  **numpy** & **opencv-python** at the moment.<br>
