# Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs
The theoretical part of Jovian.ai's [deep learning course](https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans) is not as good as Andrew Ng's _Deep Learning Specialization_ but the coding and technical part of Jovian's courses are quite rich and filled with beautiful Pytorch modules.
