# What is this repo all about?
This is the "vault" of my bootcamp files and more than half of the files are in Turkish. So, for a long time, these files will remain the same and not be useful much for an English speaker. "One day", I'll translate all of them to English and create a nice tutorial out of them.

* **Subject 1-2-3:** Introduction/Python/Statistics
* **Subject 4:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA, Missing, Extreme Values etc.)
* **Subject 6:** Regression Problems (Linear R., OLS)
* **Subject 7:** Classification Problems (Imbalanced, Metrics, CV)
* **Subject 8:** Supervised ML Algorithms (KNN, D.Trees, RF, SVM, Boosting)
* **Subject 9:** Clustering Algorithms (kmeans, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, GMM)
* **Subject 10:** Dimension Reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
* **Subject 11:** Deep Learning (ANN, CNN, RNN)
