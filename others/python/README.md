## (Deprecated) Journey of a mechanical engineer in coding universe
Whenever I come up with an idea or see an exercise that teaches me something, I put it here and have notes to myself.
Once in a while, you may see comments longer than the code itself ðŸ˜… It will change in time, hopefully.

If you are a beginner like me, some of these solutions may teach you too a few tricks. Else, at least you find yourself reading a man's "logbook" over the struggles against the wilderness of Python jungle.
### Let me introduce the examples here:

1) **[Three & Five](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex1_threeFive.py):** This is a simple problem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and the quest is to *find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000*. If you are a math lover, I strongly advise you to create an account and start solving harder problems because unlocking solutions there really gives you a sense of achievement at the end.
2) **[Factorials](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex2_factorials.py):** As the name states, you find the factori... You got the idea.
3) **[100-year-old](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex3_100-year-old.py):** Another simple exercise from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org). It's a decent website that gives the solutions beforehand unlike Project Euler. A nice beginner feeder. I'm planning to solve all of the exercises eventually.
4) **[Prime Numbers](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex4_prime-numbers.py):** Yeah, I know. The title of this code is unprecedentedly mysterious as well. Guess what does it do? :|
5) **[Fibonacci Obsession](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex5_fibonacci-obsession.py):** And this is how I present my Fibonacci obsession through a computer language.
6) **[List Ends](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex6_list-ends.py):** "Do not underestimate the potential of a simple example." I said to myself. It was an interesting usage of map() function.
7) **[The Luggage](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex7_the-luggage.py):** Now, this one is funny because it should have been a simple problem from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/11/11/20-element-search.html) but it became a game, I don't know how. (The game itself is not funny though. Sorry.ðŸ˜•)
8) **[Palindrome](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex8_palindrome.py):** is one of those things that you already know your whole life but don't know what it's called. This is the only example that I cheated after giving up and spending hours on the solution. *I defiled my sacred vow to Python gods already!*
9) **[Read from File](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex9_read-from-file.py):** I spent a few hours to figure out the correct ***for*** structure here but it was the most fun part of the example. Then I got rid of the local files and made the code a bit more *online.* And the result? Trust me, it's virus-free. You can execute it without wearing a mask. \*coughs\*
10) **[Class Examples](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex10_class-examples.ipynb)**: The Object Oriented Programming side of Python is the hardest thing to understand as well as the most fun part for me. Also this is my _primero ejemplo_ on Jupyter Notebook.
11) **[Code Wars](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex11_code-wars.py)**: I wanted to share a simple challenge (a.k.a _kata_ in Code Wars) from this beautiful website. I appreciate all the efford behind this _slick_ design as it undoubtedly hones my coding skills day by day. Why don't you check out [my profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/gul.mert89) and challenge me maybe?

**[Update]** In March, I started a bootcamp on Data Science and learned tons of stuff including deep learning and computer vision. So it wouldn't be logical to add here any code related to these subjects because they would have been way too advance considering the previous codes. Keeping here as a _pure python_ repository will be a better idea, imo. I feel like I'm on the verge of being a data scientist of any kind so when I find the job (and have the time), will keep here busy as well. Wish me luck on finding that job! I hope it will be the ***Journey of an ex-mechanical engineer in coding universe***!

12) **[Max Factor](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/master/ex12_why-simpler.py)**: Imagine I get a sponsor from such a conglomerate to one of my codes that no one reads :'D but no. This code is not about cosmetics. It's a simple example from the Project Euler. I would like to have this solution here because I am still surprised how I got it so simple!
13) **[Text to Integer](https://github.com/gulmert89/pytholution/blob/main/ex13_parse-int.py)**: This is actually a useful code to turn TEXT based numbers to ACTUAL numbers with my `parse_int()` function.
