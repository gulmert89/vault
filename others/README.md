# 2. Ruby Basics
```rb
=begin
These notes are taken from the Ruby tutorial in Codecademy.
The projects cover pretty much everything but probably not everything.
So, be careful when a recap is needed!
=end

### 1st Lesson: Introduction
# First Project: Putting the form in Formatter
print "What's your first name? "
first_name = gets.chomp
first_name.capitalize!

print "...and your last name? "
last_name = gets.chomp
last_name.capitalize!

print "Your city? "
city = gets.chomp
city.downcase!  # It's here for example.

print "State? "
state = gets.chomp
state.upcase!

print "#{first_name} #{last_name} is from #{city.capitalize!}, #{state}."


### 2nd Lesson: Control Flow
test_1 = (true || false) || (false && true)  # should be true
test_2 = (true && (3 < 4)) && (false || (0 == 0))  # should be true
test_3 = (false || false) || !(true || false)  # should be false

is_liar = false
print "Truth has been spoken!" unless is_liar
# Outputs: "Truth has been spoken!"

# Second Project: Duffy Duckifier
puts 3.times {puts "Welcome!"}

print "Provide an input: "

user_input = gets.chomp
user_input.downcase!

if user_input.include? "s"
  user_input.gsub!(/s/, "th")
  puts user_input
elsif user_input.length == 0
  puts "Please enter a string."
else
  puts "There is no 's' character(s) in the input string."
end


### 3nd Lesson: Looping
counter = 1
until counter > 10
  puts counter
  counter += 1
end

for num in 1...21
    puts num
  end

i = 20
loop {  # loop do ... end
  i -= 1
  next if i % 2 == 1
  print "#{i}"
  break if i <= 0

# Third Project: Redacted!
puts "Sentence: "
text = gets.chomp.downcase

redact = gets.chomp.downcase
words = text.split(" ")

words.each do |w|
  if w == redact
    print "REDACTED "
  else

  end
end


### 4th Lesson: Arrays & Hashes

# Fourth Project: Create a Histogram
puts "Text: "

frequencies.each do |w, c|
  puts w + " " + c.to_s  # or String(c)

### 5th Lesson: Blocks & Sorting

# They’re immutable, meaning they can’t be changed once they’re created,
# Only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory,
# Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because of the above two reasons.

"some_string".to_sym  # ==> :some_string
"some_string".intern  # ==> :some_string

# 4. YAML Basics & Notes
* These notes are from this [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFVr15xDGg). Also, [this website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm) seems to provide some docs for basics.
* YAML is a data serialization language like XML, JSON.
* Same code in YAML, XML & JSON respectively:
	```yaml
    microservices:
        - app: user-authentication
		  port: 9000
		  version: 1.0
	```
	```xml
    <microservices>
		<microservice>
			<app>user-authentication</app>
			<port>9000</port>
			<version>1.0</version>
		</microservice>
	</microservices>
	```
	```json
	{
        "microservices": [
			{
				"app": "user-authentication",
				"port": 9000,
				"version": "1.0"
			}
		]
	}
	```
* YAML is more human readable & intuitive. It uses indentation and line separation. It is used in Docker Compose, Ansible, Prometheus, Kubernetes etc. 
* Basic syntax:
    ```yaml
    # simple key: value pairs
    app: user-authentication
    port: 9000
    version: 1.7
    ```
* Quotes are optional in the strings unless you are using special character like ``\n``.
* **Objects** to group things by indenting:
    * Note: You can use a YAML validator ([like this](https://onlineyamltools.com/edit-yaml)) since indentations could be hard to match.
    ```yaml
    microservice:  # this is the obj.
        app: user-authentication  # these are the attributes.
        port: 9000
        version: 1.7
        labels:  # object in an object.
            tag: nginx
    ```
* **Lists** & **lists in lists**.
    ```yaml
    microservice:
        - app: user-authentication  # 1st item in the list
          port: 9000
          version: 1.7  # Watch out for the indentation!
          deployed: true  # true/false, on/off, yes/no. All are valid.
        - app: shopping-cart  # 2nd item in the list
          ports:
            - 9002  # list in the list
            - 9003  # the validator gave me error when I removed the dash here.
            - 9004  # but not on this one. It could be a bug. This is the right way!
          versions: [1.9, "2.2", false, 3]  # for only primitive data types!
    
    other_microservice:
        - user-authentication
        - false  # could be such simple values as well
        
    ```
* Multi-line Strings
    * We use a pipe ``|`` character to do it. Like `\n` version in Python.
    * If we want yaml to interpret the string as a one-line sentence, we use ``>``.
        * It puts a whitespace by itself, don't leave one at the end.
    ```yaml
    multiLineString: |  # or > if one-liner
        this is a multiline string,
        and should be all on line
        really, okay?
    # output:
    # {
    #     "multiLineString": "this is a multiline string,\nand should be all on line\nreally, okay?\n"
    # }
    ```
    * `>-` or `|-` removes the linebreak (``\n``) appended at the end. It is called _block chomping indicator_. There are more crazy combinations here in this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/how-do-i-break-a-string-in-yaml-over-multiple-lines) post.
    * Real life example:
    ```yaml
    command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash -e
            http () {
                local path="${1}"
                set -- -XGET -s --fail
                # some more stuff here
                curl -k "$@" "http://localhost:5601${path}"
            }
            http "/app/kibana"
    ```
* Environment variables (we do it with ``$`` sign.)
    ```yaml
    command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -ec
        - >-
            mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u -root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e 'SELECT 1'
    ```
* Placeholders (its syntax is double curly braces ``{{ ... }}``)
    * This value get replaced using template generator.
    ```yml
    metadata:
        name: {{ .Values.service.name }}
    spec:
        selector:
            app: {{ .Values.service.app }}
        ports:
            - protocol: TCP
            port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
    ```
* If you wanna group your multiple yaml file into one, the syntax for it is three dashes `---`.
    ```yaml
    # simple key: value pairs
    app: user-authentication
    port: 9000
    version: 1.7
    ---
    microservice:  # this is the obj.
    app: user-authentication  # these are the attributes.
    port: 9000
    version: 1.7
    labels:  # object in an object.
        tag: nginx
    ```
